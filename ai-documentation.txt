Infrastructure files
Python module
and
Git workflow: helped guide me through git commands for committing, resolving merge conflicts, and pushing to the class GitHub organization.
prompts included:
"I have provided 3 data sets below. Could you tell me if they are the same data sets, and if they match the project proposal?"
"whats going on here?" (when terminal showed > prompt waiting for input)"
outputs included: 
"Examined the CSV, Excel, and PDF files programmatically. Confirmed all three contain the same CDC Table 8 data in different formats. Recommended using the CSV for analysis since it's in tidy format with all years (1999–2018)."
"Explained the heredoc command got cut off, advised pressing Ctrl+C, then provided an alternative method using Python to write the file."
